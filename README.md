# Food consumption and nutritional trends

The project involves analysis for ood consumption and nutritional trends with **BigQueryML**, Python, Pyspark, BigQuery, Power BI, Looker Studio.



## Build with

The project uses:
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [PySpark, SparkSQL](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html)
* [Google Cloud Platform (Dataproc, BigQueryML)](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=fr)
* [Shell script](https://www.shellscript.sh/)
* [Power BI](https://www.microsoft.com/fr-fr/power-platform/products/power-bi) or [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/)

Ressources uses:
* [Open Food Fact](https://fr.openfoodfacts.org/data)



## How it works
* Launch of an init with <u>PySpark</u> to retrieve Open Food Fact data.
* ETL pipeline launched with <u>PySpark</u> to transform data.
* Feed <u>BigQuery</u> tables after the ETL process.
* Building Machine Learning models with <u>BigQueryML</u>.
* Dashboard construction.


## Install

You need an GCP account.

### Requirements

* Python
* Spark
* GCP Account (cloud)
* Git
* BI tool (Power BI or Google Looker Studio)


### GCP

1. Have a GCP account or create an account with a free trial product.
2. Create a new project.
3. Use the console to create elements.
4. Follow script instructions [coming_soon]() to create only your own elements.
5. **!!!Attention!!!**, you don't need to run the whole script and you need to update the commands with your own information.
